# Building a Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network with Qiskit

## Description:

This repository is a study about Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network, where I am reproducing the code created on the following [tutorial](https://medium.com/qiskit/implement-a-hybrid-quantum-classical-neural-network-with-qiskit-7f732ed3b42a) created by Daniel Sierra-Sosa, Parmeet Singh Chani, Hojun Lee, Emilio Pel√°ez and Anuranan Das.
